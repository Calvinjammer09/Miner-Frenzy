# Miner-Frenzy
## My project using the Cave Crawer assets from Game Jam Studio and Pygame.  

## Miner Frenzy is a game where you play as a miner who got stuck in the underground and must kill enemies to get out.  

## To initialize the python venv, run these commands:  

cd game  
python3 -m venv env  
. env/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

### To run the game:

python game.py

If you get the error "can't open file 'path_to_miner_frenzy/Miner-Frenzy/game.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory", your terminal is in the wrong folder and you need to go into the "game" folder.  
On Linux, use "mv game". On MacOS or Windows, use "cd game", then type "python game.py" to run.

## Running without python:

If you wish to run the game but don't want to make a virtual environment or edit the code, go to your OS's respective folder and download that instead.  

### NOTE:   
These releases will be behind the python code, as I only want to release when I am sure I have a good and new version of the game.   
Do not expect the same thing as the python version to come out of those versions. I will also not be releasing the Mac versions and Linux versions as often.
