# Miner-Frenzy
## My project using the Cave Crawer assets from Game Jam Studio and Pygame.  

## Miner Frenzy is a game where you play as a miner who got stuck in the underground and must kill enemies to get out.  

### To initialize the python venv, run these commands:  

cd game  
python3 -m venv env  
. env/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

### To run the game:

python game.py

If you get the error "can't open file 'path_to_miner_frenzy\\Miner-Frenzy\\game.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory", your terminal is in the wrong folder and you need to go into the "game" folder.  
On Linux, use "mv game". On MacOS or Windows, use "cd game".
